## Information We Collect

This is an optional feature, and you control what academic information you provide.

## Student-Provided Academic Data and FERPA

UMN.lol is an independent service and is **not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by the University of Minnesota**.

To provide personalized academic insights, our service allows you, the user, to voluntarily provide your academic records, such as an Academic Progress Audit System (APAS) report. These records fall under the protection of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a U.S. Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

FERPA restricts educational institutions from disclosing student records without student consent. However, FERPA also grants students the right to obtain and share their own records. When you upload your academic report to our platform, you are exercising your personal right to share your own data with a third-party service of your choosing.

## Consent for Academic Data Processing

By uploading a document containing your academic records, you give UMN.lol your explicit and informed consent to process this data for the sole purpose of enhancing your user experience. This processing includes:

1.  **Extracting** course information, including course codes, titles, and the grades you received.
2.  **Analyzing** this data to identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in your academic performance.
3.  **Generating** text embeddings from these analyses to power a personalized AI advisor.

Your academic data and the insights derived from it are used exclusively within your private account, are not shared with any external entity, and are protected under the "Data Protection" section of this policy.

## Your Data Rights and Deletion

You maintain full control over the personal and academic data you provide to UMN.lol.

You have the right to request the permanent deletion of your account and all associated data at any time. This includes your profile information, any academic data you have uploaded, and all derived analyses and embeddings stored in our systems. You can initiate this process directly from your user profile page. Deletion is irreversible and will be processed immediately.

## Use of Google APIs

your class schedule to your calendar. The data we collect from Google APIs is used solely for the purpose of
providing this feature. This data does not leave your device, and we do not store any of your Google Calendar data on
our servers. We do not share any of your data with any third parties or use it for any other purposes
than providing the class schedule feature.

## Limited Use Policy

Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes)_,
including the Limited Use requirements.

## Data Protection
